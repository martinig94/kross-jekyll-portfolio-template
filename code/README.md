## Guide on using the generated images

### Overlay images for parallax effect

- Copy your image from `\code\figures\` or any other source
- Pase your image into `\assets\images\illustrations\`
- Add the reference to your image in `\_includes\hero-section.html`
- Adjust the position of the image `\_sass\templates\_hero-area.scss`

You have to take care that images have the right size. It is recommnded to use smaller png images with transparent background.
